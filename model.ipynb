I purchased one each of the three petit four flavors they had available. Got home and was absolutely blown away at how moist and flavorful (yet light!) they each were. Loved all three flavors (vanilla, rose, lavender). \\xa0In terms of consistency and taste they reminded me of some of the better cakes I had while in Sweden (sigh, if anyone knows where I can get a good princesstorte in nyc, lmk!). Really tempted to go back and pick up more... \\xa0Beautiful packaging too, would make great gifts. They are a bit pricey for the size but they're really delicious and stand out amongst other sweets options in the city. Great customer service, too. Highly recommend!\",\n",

Tbf petit fours are bitesize tea snacks, but bon vivant sells the standard (british-y) ones: two layers of sponge cakes with buttercream in between, covered by sugary icing. The result is a moist bite of scrumptiousness. \\n\\nBoth the owner and one of the bakers were welcoming and cordial, and they were able to help me choose a pretty box of four. The place so so adorable and cute and dainty! \\n\\nFor their sizes, these things may seem expensive BUT like max 3 places in new york make petit fours and you really only need one to be satisfied. It's sort of like why macarons are so expensive. There are skill and dedication required to make these tiny delicate things to perfection and they're so decadent that one really is enough (and this is coming from a dessert-addict).

Coffee was pretty good, it had a great taste and it was well steamed. \\nI recommend the cappuccino. I appreciate the lids of the coffee cup which makes it easy to drink out of. We also tried one of their small cakes. The cake was moist and delicious! Well at least the dough was, but the icing wasn't very good. I ended up eating the insides of the cake without the icing, which was good quality and pretty heavy. \\nService was really great and the barista was so sweet!

I knew that the cakes were high end and the flour used for them was special and from France so they could eat it.\\nTaste: the cakes are small and beautiful. They have just the right amount of sweetness and I am always amazed how a flavor like lavender can be locked into a pastry this well.\\nThe petite cakes are a bit pricier compared to other pastries, but in my opinion they are worth it. It's a beautiful, tasty, original and different product.\",\n",

However, a trip to Kirsh left me feeling reeeeally really good.\\n\\nThe Beau and I went for brunch on a Saturday afternoon around 1 p.m.; props to the new Yelp feature I was unaware of, in which the host put our name into their system and I got a text link telling me our approximate wait time AND the number of parties in front of us! After a scant 10 minute wait, we were seating in their bright - though a tad tight - dining area.\\n\\nThrillist recently toted Kirsh as having the best French Toast on the Upper West Side, and that is a very fair assessment! There are a variety of options - both sweet and savory - and he went for the sweet Cinnamon Pear version, complete with mascarpone cheese on the side. This truly epitomized excellent French toast: the bread was thick, but airy. The flavor was buttery, fruity, and spicy without being overwhelmingly sweet. The mascarpone was a nice alternative to butter and helped lighten up the flavor of the dish even more. \\n\\nI was almost sad I didn't order any for myself...but I can be TOO sad, because their BLTE - a BLT with emmental cheese - was easily one of the best BLTs I've EVER had in my LIFE. The key was preparation: the bacon was chopped up and melded with the melted cheese; unlike traditional BLTs in which the bacon is in strips in the sandwich, there was even distribution of bacon in every bite I took. I'm sure we've all had a BLT in which, before we know it, the strips of bacon have disappeared long before the lettuce or tomato, leaving the remnants of a sad sandwich. Haaa. Plus, the buttery roll it was all served upon was perfection, and the mound of fries sealed the deal. Actually, no, the EPIC RANCH DRESSING served on the side was what sealed the deal. DAMN. DELICIOUS. I was dipping my sandwich into it, no shame. HA!\\n\\nOf course, if the staff was awful, I would not give this spot five stars. The staff was so lovely all around; even one waitress accidentally spilled part of my drink on my foot and was so apologetic, but so what? Accidents happen and they were responsible and cleaned it up right away! Service is definitely top-notch at Kirsh. \\n\\nIt was a meal that we were talking about for the rest of the day, and we're already planning to go back, if only to the bakery, which has it's own lovely menu to choose from. \\n\\nWe've wanted to try Kirsh for a while, and now I'm just mad that I waited to long to try this epic gem!\",\n",
       "   'Went here for lunch during a weekday so there was no wait at all. My friend and I ordered the lox french toast and the quiche of the day to share.\\nFood:\\n-Lox french toast: 4/5. The french toast bread was definitely the star of the dish. It was pretty light and refreshing with the creme fresh. Could do with more pieces of salmon, though.\\n-Daily quiche: 3.5/5. This was a very heavy dish since there was a pretty heavy layer of cheese melted on top of the quiche but it complimented well with the side salad. Ranch was also provided on the side. The quiche seemed a little bland without the ranch sauce. \\n\\nService: 3/5. Servers were pretty nonresponsive - my friend and I tried to catch their attention for a long time to get an extra plate and we ended up having to get up and ask for one. Also, they could have notified us what the quiche of the day was when we ordered it.\\n\\nTip: check your bill! Apparently they gave us an old menu with old prices and the bill we got had the new, higher prices. They happily changed the prices for us, though.\\n\\nI also ordered an almond danish to go. I thought it was a bit dense for a danish and it didn\\'t feel like it was \"fresh\"/baked that day. There were visible layers, though, and I could definitely taste them! The almond flavor wasn\\'t really distributed throughout the pastry - I think I only got a bit of the marzipan just on the side of the danish. It wasn\\'t terrible, though! 3.5/5',\n",
       "   'I had Kirsch down as one of my top brunch places to try, in part because while I love Jacob\\'s Pickles in theory, a part of me would prefer not to need a long afternoon nap to shake off the food coma. The brunch menu at Kirsch covers the full spectrum but to be honest, I was here for one thing: the Healthy Breakfast. I am a sucker for dishes that have a huge variety of different things on one plate and yes, I am that person that eats each item separately, saving what I think is the best for last. Hence, which is also why I love:\\n\\n- Westside\\'s veggie market platter \\n- Bento boxes of any kind \\n\\nThe Healthy Breakfast comes with two slices of absolute GODLY toast, scrambled egg whites, half of an avocado, a little cup of yogurt, and a heap of green salad. \\n\\nHere is how you luxuriate in this plate of food: douse the yogurt in honey. Or you could also try dipping home fries in the yogurt. Then slather the avocado on top of the toast. Which is what I should have done but did not because the bread was too damn good to eat on its own. The crust tasted vaguely of asiago cheese. I savored every bite. \\n\\nAnd yes, I paid $14 for a breakfast that I could have assembled in ten minutes at home. But I think the bread alone was worth the sticker price. \\n\\nHere are the \"eh\\'s\":\\n1. My boyfriend said his cheeseburger was average. I\\'m no expert on burgers like I am on granola but this burger was a bit too ... wet. It literally gushed out juice. Shouldn\\'t burgers have more structural integrity? If you want a good burger, the Milling Room does an unexpectedly fantastic one. \\n\\n2. It was definitely on the louder side. It didn\\'t help that we were seated right next to the cutlery drawers.',\n",

In the front area is the bakery where there are croissants, cakes, pie, tarts, bread galore! I restrained myself because I knew I was just about to eat. \\n\\nThe dining area is homey and lovely with a nice amount of space. My friend and I decided to share the Bacon, Egg and Cheese French Toast and an Omelette. \\n\\nThe Bacon, Egg and Cheese French Toast was amazing! There are 2 huge, fluffy, thick pieces of bread with plenty of melted cheese and bacon baked in, along with 2 fried eggs on top. The bacon was fried to perfection, the cheese was wonderfully melty and the whole thing was absolutely mouthwatering! The egg was a yummy touch. \\n\\nFor the omelette, we had a choice of 2 ingredients and chose mushrooms and Gruyere cheese. It also came with home fries, toast and a small green salad. The omelette was just okay for me. The egg and mushroom did not have a ton of flavor. Also, there didn't seem to be a lot of mushroom. The potaotoes were good though and seasoned well. The salad was fresh and had just the right amount of Italian vinegrette dressing. I also liked the rye multigrain bread, which was slightly toasted with a great taste of rye.\\n\\nService was on point and I would definitely come back. The Chocolate Peanut Butter French Toast sounds delicious and they even serve Full English Breakfast. I would like to try some cakes and pastries from their bakery as well.\",\n",

It took me a while to make these choices as I'm almost positive that everything else on that menu/shelf was just as good. I wish people at the cashier smiled more, but then everything matters less after you bite into carbs heaven. Will be back for that incredible latte too!\",\n",

It was very thick cut and crispy on the outside and ridiculously soft and fluffy on the inside. The marscapone was just a little sweet and the jam was a little tart and they paired so well together.

       "  'reviews': [\"Evening on the town after leaving treat house we decided to have some Italian food only because I was graving meatballs, this is definitely a cool little spot for brunch with friends. \\nThe service was nice and quick waitress super friendly and attentive. I ordered \\xa0meatball sliders and truffle fries that was to die for. \\n\\nThe meatball slides were perfect!!!! , they were only appetizers (I believe )but very filling omg I'll go back to order the exact same thing \\n\\nMy husband ordered chicken pam but it doesnt come with pasta which he found disappointing. \\n\\nOverall I would return, nice atmosphere and love the neighborhood\",\n",
       "   'For a place by someone named \"Nicky Meatballs\" & voted \"Best Meatballs in the Five Boroughs\" you\\'d think they\\'d take some pride in their meatballs or their menu. \\xa0\\n\\nTheir menu boasts some interesting non-meatball sliders which are advertised in the menu to come \"...on brioche rolls, with mixed greens\". \\xa0When I inquired about these my server informed me that I must have an old menu (it\\'s the same menu still listed online) and unfortunately they no longer come with mixed greens. \\xa0Understandable - I know how much extra that bag o\\' greens can run them for the $14 sliders. \\xa0So I ordered the regular:\\n\"Sliders - Nicky\\'s Famous Sauced meatballs on brioche rolls.\" - figuring a place named by a man with the last name of \"Meatballs\", \\xa0which was voted \"Best Meatballs...blah....\" would be worth the $14.\\n\\nI. Got. 3. Full. Meatballs. On. Tiny. Dinner Rolls.\\n\\nTiny. Dinner. Rolls.\\n\\nNo Brioche. \\xa0No salad. \\xa0 I could have sworn the menu there mentioned they\\'d be sliced. \\xa0Nope. \\xa0I sliced my own damn balls.\\n\\nNOT worth $14. \\xa0I tasted better meatballs from my ex\\'s Aunt in Jersey and those were free - and don\\'t get me started on how many other sides were offered for the price of nothing.\\n\\nIf your menus are wrong - change them - or honor what is listed. \\xa0If not - change you\\'re ridiculous prices for shitty meatballs on tiny dinner rolls.',\n",
       "   \"The entrees are generally very tasty and the meatballs are satisfying. \\xa0The puttanesca sauce is great. \\xa0The only issue I have is that to get a small side of pasta (which is how I like to enjoy my chicken milanese, francese etc) is $11. \\xa0That seems very steep for a small portion of pasta and some sauce which prob costs them $1. \\xa0Ironically the sausage side dish is only $9. \\xa0\\nCozy ambiance, nice servers. This is more of an eat-in place vs order in. \\n I don't think they are set up to do that efficiently. \\xa0As an aside: why reviewers who try to abuse the bottomless brunch drinks feel they have a right to stay all day and then give lousy reviews when they aren't allowed to go beyond the stated time limit? Nuts\",\n",
       "   \"The BEST meatballs I've ever had!!! \\xa0And don't get me started on their vodka sauce. It's making my mouth water just thinking about it. \\xa0If you're in NYC, this place is a MUST DO!\",\n",
       "   \"This used to be our favorite restaurant in the neighborhood- we always looked forward to dining here with family, about once a month for dinner and happy hour every few weeks. \\n\\nA few months ago, the service changed and everything went completely downhill. We showed up at 5pm for a pre-theater dinner. Restaurant was empty. Our usual server said that they could not accommodate our party of 3 without a reservation because they had a party coming in an hour. They don't even accept reservations for under 4 people! How could I have made a reservation when I was told they wouldn't accept it! \\n\\nWe finally went back this weekend for brunch and the same server remembered us but was still cold and unfriendly. After we asked for the check and a final round of drinks, she came back and said that we were over the 2 hour time limit but she allowed us extra time etc. The whole interaction made me very uncomfortable. \\n\\nWe gave Polpette a second chance because we used to love their brunch, service, and atmosphere but I can say we won't be back after two rude interactions with staff.\",\n",

       "   'If you want great Italian food and an overall good experience, this place is it. They probably have the best meatballs I\\'ve ever had (which is good for a place that\\'s name means \"big meatball\"), but all of their food is great. I\\'ve had their meatballs, chicken francese, chicken marsala, various pastas, and more and they\\'ve all been fantastic. And the Montepulciano we always order there is great too. We\\'ve been a bunch since our friends are regulars, and the service is great as well! It\\'s a cozy place with nice ambiance, it\\'s reasonably priced, and the portions are good. Note: If you order a meat dish it doesn\\'t come with pasta, but you can always order a half portion with the same sauce (even if the sauce you chose is marsala, francese, etc) to go along with it. And the tiramisu? Also delicious! Definitely recommend!',\n",
       "   'I would consider myself a \"regular\" at this quaint and friendly Italian on the UWS. \\xa0Prices reasonable and the place has a \"family\" feel to it as the staff is always nice and accommodating. \\xa0Traditional Italian dishes are great- Chicken Parm and the choices of pasta and sauces are plenty. \\xa0Signature dishes are the meatballs which can be served in a number of different ways and can be had as an appetizer or along with the main dish (we tend to order and eat with the pasta). Bolognese sauce is great and would recommend. \\xa0Not dessert person, but they do offer some really good and fresh ones. \\xa0They usually have some good specials and salads are particularly retesting and innovative (and fresh). \\xa0Stop by, you will not be disappointed. \\xa0A great place to stop by before and after a movie on the west side.',\n",

       "   \"As I was searching for a unique Italian restaurant in the upper west side, this was one of the top restaurants that always came up, so I had to try it. I came with a couple of friends, and we each ordered a different type of pasta. We sat outside, as they were full inside. The outdoor seating was casual, somewhat spacious and comfortable, but no issues there. I ordered the farfalle puttanesca with meatballs. Besides the pasta being slightly overpriced, I have to say that I wasn't disappointed! It was extremely flavorful and there was plenty of sauce to enjoy the pasta with. Their claim of having the best meatballs in all 5 boroughs I feel is pretty accurate, as their meatballs tasted fresh and had a slight kick to it. Overall, I would say that this is a great place to treat yourself and to take family and friends for a fancy dinner!\",\n",
       "   \"Polpette is my absolute go-to restaurant when I'm in the upper west side. It's a one-of-a-kind neighborhood treasure. I personally go for the vodka sauce with the many different types of house-made pastas, and of course wine Wednesday's! I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some really great Italian food!\",\n",
       "   'Delicious little hole-in-the-wall with charming painted walls. The black linguine with seafood was perfectly cooked.\\n\\nThey lose a star for table-turning. I came here in a party of six to celebrate an engagement. We all ordered entrees and wine, we were there an hour and a half total from the moment we sat down, yet minutes after paying our bill we were asked to leave. I get it, Saturday night on the Upper West Side is busy. But we had a reservation, we were quiet and polite and not spending hours occupying a table, and we spent good money. It left a really bad taste in my mouth to be essentially kicked out. I would hesitate to go back because of that. It was embarrassing.',\n",
       "   'Not good... Not delicious... \\n\\nOUTSTANDING!\\n\\nI called around noon to see whether I could make a reservation for 3 that night, and the woman I spoke with on the phone, Cristina, said, \"we usually don\\'t take reservations for groups smaller than 4, but tell me when you\\'ll be coming and I\\'ll keep an eye out for you.\"\\n\\nTrue to her word, when we got there, Cristina had a table waiting for us. We were greeted by a number of folks, whether to give us the menus, take our drink orders, deliver indescribably delicious bread, or present the food we ordered, and each one was as affable as the next. Cristina, however, really took care of us -- the perfect balance of checking in, chit-chatting over the meal and letting us eat and socialize on our own. Even on a busy Saturday night, where the place was packed, we didn\\'t feel rushed for a moment. Service was seamless, no matter who came to help us out.\\n\\nIt is SMALL -- great for date night, a group of 3 -- but don\\'t go if it\\'s a group, unless you plan ahead and really take over the restaurant. It does get loud, but not too much so that you can\\'t hear each other and have a good conversation.\\n\\nIn terms of food: EAT THE BREAD. Don\\'t give me that crap that you\\'re not doing carbs, you\\'re at an Italian restaurant. Whatever olive oil they offer, too, is delicious -- so grab a small hunk of that bread, dip it in the olive oil, and send me a message here that says, \"OMG, you were totally right.\" \\n\\nTwo of us had appetizers -- one arugula salad, and one salad with a sautéed portobello mushroom, also over arugula. Both were delicious -- fresh arugula, very flavorful but not overpowering vinaigrette.\\n\\nThe pastas.... the PASTAS. Holy expletive. One friend is gluten sensitive, and she got the gluten free penne with the garlic and broccoli rabe and loved it. My partner had pasta bolognese, which I tasted, and it was excellent. I had the tortellini with prosciutto and peas in an alfredo sauce -- and it was one of the best pasta dishes I\\'ve ever had. I reluctantly shared some with my partner, and even after forking over several (that was really pushing it...) tastes, there was plenty left. The sauce is, as you can imagine from my description, extremely rich.\\n\\nThey have a full bar, and a nice wine selection for a restaurant of that size. I had the Montepulciano, and it was delicious. \\n\\nI really cannot wait to go back to Polpette again -- definitely want to try their meatballs, too, considering their name and reputation for them. In the meantime, go and enjoy.\\n\\nMultumesc, Cristina and everyone, for a wonderful evening!',\n",

After the food was delivered, I was completely baffled to find the Paneer completely soaked in and dripping with OIL and large tasteless cucumbers in the Indo-Chinese Fried rice. The food nevertheless was unworthy for the $28 that was paid and only left to sleep without a filled tummy.\\n\\nRuchi restaurant, though it's understandable that you could be serving high number of orders, you need to be mindful that we didn't choose your restaurant hastily or randomly out of the innumerable number of restaurants that showed up in Grubhub or eat out of charity but after reading the mixed reviews and by paying you. Be a responsible food-provider when a customer chooses you to serve his dinner for the night and pay you for every single bit of rice and piece of vegetable that you paid and bought, in order to cook.

It is rather small and cozy so its difficult to find a table for more than four people. Everyone must order an entree. \\n\\nI ordered chicken vindaloo and it definitely packed a punch! I was warned that it would be spicy but I didn't realize the level of spiciness it would be. If you can't handle spicy food - please don't get it. The chicken itself was a bit overcooked and they try hiding it with all that sauce. One of my coworkers ordered the chicken saag, which I found a bit salty and the chicken was also overcooked. You definitely need to some rice or naan for all this saucy food. \\n\\nThe entree does not come with rice or naan - so you have to order it! It is also half price so its not too bad. I have to admit that the portions are smaller than I expected. But overall, remember that it is FiDi and a dine-in lunch at a restaurant for $12-$13 after tax and tip is amazing.\",\n",

The Chicken Tikka Masala was awesomely spiced, gravy and garnished with pickled veggies and ginger. The naan tasted freshly baked and still warm wrapped in the aluminum foil.

Of course I'd go for something different. Goat kadhai I declared. It was a red stew thickened by a slurry of peppers, onions and goat. Boy it was oil ladened, but so good. The crab curry was indeed delicious- tried and true, about 15 times over by the faithful congregation. A coconut creaminess that melded the sweet crab, salted only slightly and perfumed with earthy Indian warm spices. The entrees were served over pots of basmati rice and roti, which were unassumingly thin, chewy and perfect for dipping. \\n\\nRuchi's is tiny and fills up within the hour by the hour for good reason.

       "   \"Ruchi is an ok place, and certainly the half prices for lunch are attractive. And while very very popular and busy for lunch, it suffers from its own success. For example, I like a lot of water when I'm eating Indian food. It was impossible to get someone to refill the cup. They were just running around trying to get too many people fed. Too many for the size of the place and the number of staff. Really, someone should be checking water glasses anyhow. I told the person who brought our bill, and also pointed out the burnt bread they had served us. A kitchen should have more pride than to serve something so unappealing. \\n\\nEarlier my buddy checked about the half price deal and the waiter told us to order from the right hand page of the menu. I'm still not sure if he misunderstood but they did charge us only half for our two entrees. If you visit, it would be a good idea to get that straight before you order. \\n\\nI had shrimp masala which was fine, but not the best masala I've ever had. My friend had some fish in coconut curry. It was also satisfactory. Especially for the price. \\n\\nAnyhow, one visit here was enough.\",\n",
       "   \"I used to live around the corner from Ruchi and walked by several times per week for almost 2 years before trying it out and that was a serious regret. \\xa0Needless to say I've been picking up takeout for dinner on average once per month...sometimes more. \\xa0I like the North Indian dinner special which only seems to be available for takeout. It's a great value, including a small container of rice, a piece of naan, a small portion appetizer, entree and mini sides of chutney/raita. \\xa0I've tried several combinations but I always go back to ordering the samosas appetizer and chicken tikka masala. \\xa0The butter chicken is similar, but tikka has my heart. \\xa0They don't always read the special instructions (like when I ask for extra raita instead of chutney) so I'd make sure to call in case. \\n\\nI've dined in here a few times and had nice service as well. \\xa0It's fun to go with a few people so you can order various entrees and share. \\xa0I've never gone, but they have a sandwich board outside advertising 50% off select dine-in lunch specials. \\xa0Would be worth checking out if you work in the area.\\n\\nI will say I recently picked up takeout while in the area and was a little disappointed -- the chicken tikka had far too much oil/fat in it, so much that it had risen to the top by the time I got around to eating it (about an hour later). \\xa0Also, the entree portion was smaller than I remembered from when I last ate it about 2 months ago. \\xa0I'm still willing to give it another chance to see if it was a fluke.\",\n",

A single bite, hmmm, meat is very juicy and tasty! \\n\\nOne thing really impressed us is their great service! We ordered again today and they sent us the order with items missing. They resent the rest of the order within 15minutes of our call. In addition, they gave us complimentary shrimp tempera and a box of tasty pineapple wrapped sushi!

      "However, a trip to Kirsh left me feeling reeeeally really good.\n",
      "Thrillist recently toted Kirsh as having the best French Toast on the Upper West Side, and that is a very fair assessment!\n",
      "There are a variety of options - both sweet and savory - and he went for the sweet Cinnamon Pear version, complete with mascarpone cheese on the side.\n",
      "This truly epitomized excellent French toast: the bread was thick, but airy.\n",
      "The mascarpone was a nice alternative to butter and helped lighten up the flavor of the dish even more.\n",
      "Plus, the buttery roll it was all served upon was perfection, and the mound of fries sealed the deal.\n",
      "DELICIOUS.\n",
      "The staff was so lovely all around; even one waitress accidentally spilled part of my drink on my foot and was so apologetic, but so what?\n",
      "Accidents happen and they were responsible and cleaned it up right away!\n",
      "Service is definitely top-notch at Kirsh.\n",
      "It was a meal that we were talking about for the rest of the day, and we're already planning to go back, if only to the bakery, which has it's own lovely menu to choose from.\n",
      "It was pretty light and refreshing with the creme fresh.\n",
      "This was a very heavy dish since there was a pretty heavy layer of cheese melted on top of the quiche but it complimented well with the side salad.\n",
      "They happily changed the prices for us, though.\n",
      "I thought it was a bit dense for a danish and it didn't feel like it was \"fresh\"/baked that day.\n",
      "I had Kirsch down as one of my top brunch places to try, in part because while I love Jacob's Pickles in theory, a part of me would prefer not to need a long afternoon nap to shake off the food coma.\n",
      "The brunch menu at Kirsch covers the full spectrum but to be honest, I was here for one thing: the Healthy Breakfast.\n",
      "I am a sucker for dishes that have a huge variety of different things on one plate and yes, I am that person that eats each item separately, saving what I think is the best for last.\n",
      "Hence, which is also why I love:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Westside's veggie market platter \n",
      "- Bento boxes of any kind \n",
      "\n",
      "The Healthy Breakfast comes with two slices of absolute GODLY toast, scrambled egg whites, half of an avocado, a little cup of yogurt, and a heap of green salad.\n",
      "Here is how you luxuriate in this plate of food: douse the yogurt in honey.\n",
      "Then slather the avocado on top of the toast.\n",
      "But I think the bread alone was worth the sticker price.\n",
      "I'm no expert on burgers like I am on granola but this burger was a bit too ... wet.\n",
      "If you want a good burger, the Milling Room does an unexpectedly fantastic one.\n",
      "It didn't help that we were seated right next to the cutlery drawers.\n",
      "It was only a 15 minute wait and I received a text when our table was ready.\n",
      "In the front area is the bakery where there are croissants, cakes, pie, tarts, bread galore!\n",
      "The dining area is homey and lovely with a nice amount of space.\n",
      "The Bacon, Egg and Cheese French Toast was amazing!\n",
      "The bacon was fried to perfection, the cheese was wonderfully melty and the whole thing was absolutely mouthwatering!\n",
      "The potaotoes were good though and seasoned well.\n",
      "The salad was fresh and had just the right amount of Italian vinegrette dressing.\n",
      "I also liked the rye multigrain bread, which was slightly toasted with a great taste of rye.\n",

      "It took me a while to make these choices as I'm almost positive that everything else on that menu/shelf was just as good.\n",
      "I wish people at the cashier smiled more, but then everything matters less after you bite into carbs heaven.\n",
      "Will be back for that incredible latte too!\n",

      "They were so good I went back for a late lunch and got shakshuka with mushrooms.\n",
      "It was a amazing.\n",
      "It had the right amount of spice for me (those that don't like spice might need to add more of the complimentary yogurt).\n",
      "Service was good too.\n",
      "Nothing out of the ordinary to comment on but in selecting pastries in the morning the lady was great.\n",
      "Clean, beautiful restaurant with good food and good iced coffee.\n",
      "When we arrived, we asked the waitress if there were any gluten free options (as I have celiac disease).\n",
      "She reported that there was no gluten free options at all and there was bread everywhere, which was not true and not preferable for someone with an allergy to hear.\n",
      "I wasn't thrilled with the service but my friend enjoyed her quiche and tomato soup.\n",
      "What an amazing find!\n",
      "I can honestly say this was the best French toast I have ever had in my life.\n",
      "The marscapone was just a little sweet and the jam was a little tart and they paired so well together.\n",
      "I like savory-sweet foods so the bacon was perfect with it, especially since they actually made it extra crispy (though they will make it chewy too if you ask - I saw some chewy bacon go to another table).\n",
      "The hubs had the Power Breakfast (which comes with 3 eggs, any style, potatoes, salad, bacon or sausage as your meat choice, and toast, in addition to a choice of juice with coffee or tea; I wasn't a fan of the home fries, as they had an off-taste to them, but everything else was flavored well and tasty; the hubs really enjoyed the sausage as his meat choice, as it was a thicker patty; juice was fresh, and loved the generous pour of the coffee); and, I had the Steak & Eggs (which came with gravy, garlic, and a side of roasted potatoes; the potatoes were the same as the home fries, which I wasn't a fan of; the steak was seasoned well; the highlight of the dish, though, was the housemade gravy!\n",
      "It came in a cup off to the side, and it was super tasty!\n",
      "Salty and creamy, it was fantastic dipping (or pouring all over) the steak.\n",
      "It was even great with the buttered thick toast!\n",
      "Our server was friendly, and we received our orders accurately.\n",
      "Just note that there is a to-go bakery up at the front, but the dining area is to your right when you enter.\n",

      "Came here for breakfast and had a nice meal!\n",
      "The place is very clean and tidy.\n",
      "We were seated quickly and the food was served in a good amount of time.\n",
      "Only after we asked 30m later, they looked it up then came back & told us it would be coming (still not ready), but we had to leave for work & were just deflated honestly (30-40m for eggs & toast).\n",
      "The manager was initially nice and comped the coffee we had while waiting.\n",
      "But then demeanor wasn't as warm when we let him know we couldn't continue waiting, had to leave & tried to tell us it had only been 13min.\n",
      "No smiles or apologies as we exited calmly.\n",
      "I was blown away by brunch here-- I'm usually leaving nyc brunch places saying either, that was good but why was the portion mouse sized, or that was a heaping portion size but pretty mediocre.\n",
      "Kirsh on the other hand is amazing portion size with  stellar quality:\n",
      "1) when they said mushroom and spinach omelette they will quite literally fill your omelette with huge chunks of veggies.\n",
      "2) I appreciated the diversity of food groups that all came on one plate-- eggs for protein, potatoes(and A+ seasoning and crisp to those potatoes)  for carb and guilty pleasure, and a fresh salad with mixed local greens (arugula, butter lettuce, and romaine) with a really bright and refreshing dressing \n",
      "3) this place is primarily a bakery so you already know their side of toast is going to be on point.\n",
      "I went pretty basic and ordered their burger and fries, but both were awesome.\n",
      "I've also had their almond croissant, which is super good.\n",
      "Kirsh is one of the best restaurants in Manhattan!\n",

      "The French toast was special and the salmon was very fresh.\n",
