# Background
Many people browse restaurant review sites like Yelp to pick new restaurants to try. However, picking a restaurant is only half the battle, as diners are also faced with choosing their meal amongst a variety of menu options, which can also be overwhelming in a new dining experience. In such cases, I usually turn, again, to Yelp reviews for recommendations and tips about specific menu items from past diners. The idea of my project is to build an algorithm that would perform this process so that diners would not have to go through every Yelp review of a new restaurant to know which dishes there are well-liked and which are not. The algorithm would return, for each restaurant given, a few popular menu items and some not-so-favorable ones as output. This project provides value to not only diners but also companies like Yelp and Foursquare, who could incorporate this algorithm into their own productsâ€™ functionalities.

Building a recommendation engine using named entity recognition and sentiment analysis on scraped restaurant reviews and menu data to pick out the most popular and unpopular dishes from restaurants in New York City, deployed on a web app.
