There was always an array of fresh and creative vegetable dishes and wonderful protein choices. \\nSad.\",\n",
       "  \"Treehaus is my go to spot for a bacon egg and cheese before work. The BEC at Treehaus has proven time and time again to be the best (and one of the cheapest) I have gotten during the morning rush in Manhattan. Also - if you didn't already know, you can get a side of sriracha! \\n\\nI have been a regular here for months and plan to continue coming here in the future.\",\n",
       "  \"I've been going there for a year now. I love their Korean food and hot food buffet :) Their grocery section has few Asian snacks too and they also have smoothie section but I mainly just go there for hot food bar and coffee. Their Poke is unimpressive actually.\\n\\nDrop by at night for a glass of wine and jazz live performance. Their tapas was actually very good. \\n\\nDear management - I've spotted some broke people stealing food from hot buffet twice and hope you rearrange the cashier location.\",\n",
       "  \"3.5 stars - could have been a 4 but when I got shells in my scrambled eggs, tsk tsk! \\xa0And the prices -- I just can't get over the prices. \\xa0However, upon entering I knew it wasn't going to be the best value.\\n\\nGreat buffet selections for the breakfast and lunch weighed food stations - I gotta learn to control my portions (never left spending less than $14). This is a very mod / upscale looking Deli. \\xa0The black chalkboard art and deco lights gives it a fun and chic vibe. \\xa0Efficient and clean all throughout, I'll give them that. \\xa0The first floor boasts a fancy looking coffee & juice station, then separate food stations all around. \\xa0Buffet on your right, sandwich counter on the left (rear of store), drink and snacks all around on neat display racks or mini fridges, and way in the back, the salad bar station. \\xa0Seems like it's own restaurant in the back there. \\xa0(BTW the Octopus salad is both filling and excellent with the right dressing).\\n\\nProceed upstairs via the back staircase and you'll find the sushiritto they're advertising on the front door signage. \\xa0I didn't really pay attention to the full menu but I believe there were poke options and rolls. \\xa0\\n\\nAny way, I've been here several times ... the trickiest part is navigating the buffet bar. \\xa0So many options and remember, you pay by weight. \\xa0I can't seem to win the price battle here. \\xa0A variety of goodies can be found but given the price/lb, it gets out of hand. \\xa0I do like that they have different sized recyclable containers. \\xa0The deli station while I have not tried, the menu board posts plenty of gourmet sandwiches. \\xa0Again, not much less than $10. \\xa0\\n\\nOn appearances alone, this place scores well for ambiance and selections but this is not the spot for cheap eats. \\xa0If you're willing to pay, then by all means, you will not mind.\",\n",

Imagine my surprise when I realized they had a bit of everything. I walked in with every intention of ordering the Mexican salad. I walked out with an array of protein. \\n\\nI will agree with a previous post that the layout is WEIRD. It genuinely makes no sense. The hot food bar is smack in the middle of the room and unless you walk parallel to it, you don't know it's the hot food bar. In the back and to the left you can order sandwiches and salads. It honestly looks hidden. Straight back is a kitchen apparently? I don't know, I wasn't there to explore. Upstairs there's seating and I think additional food options (?), again, I don't know. \\n\\nFor what I got - 3 stuffed mushrooms, small piece of salmon, 1/2 a slice of chicken marsala, 2 slivers of pork belly, and a La Croix, it seemed on par for average lunch prices at $10.35. \\n\\nThe mushrooms were good but a bit bland. I feel like they needed some seasoning. The salmon was good. The chicken was overcooked because the pieces were so thin. The sauce was good though. The pork belly was a bad choice. I should have known better since it was so late in the day. It was a greasy mess. Unless pork belly has a crunch to it, it's gross. \\n\\nI'll definitely come back another day to try it again since I'm big on these cafeteria styled places. I like having a lot of options under one roof.\",\n",

TERRIBLE. At this price (as per all the reviews talking about how pricey this spot is), shouldn't you take some more time to make quality EDIBLE food? \\n\\nthe chicken was soooo dry - likewise inedible. Tasted like chalk. \\n\\nThis isn't even a hit or miss anymore - the last few times have been all misses.\",\n",
       "  \"This is a great place for lunch and coffee. I agree with the remainder of the reviews that it is pricey, but they have good quality food. There are other places that charge slightly less with poor quality food ingredients. I love their buffet and the choices they provide; a lot of the options are healthy! Their sushi is also yummy. For coffee, I'm currently obsessed with their Nutella latte. It's also quite pricey. Depending on who your barista is, it's made a little differently so I always taste the coffee before I leave to make sure I'm going to enjoy it. The four stars is because of their fresh food ingredients and variety of food options. But as stated in my review, it is pricey and will cost you ~$15 for their buffet for a hearty portion.\",\n",

They just have a layout that makes sense and multiple registers to pay at. The hot/cold buffet has really tasty food (the BBQ sweet potatoes are my fave) but it's super duper expensive. The food is fresh and worth the price for let's say a sit-down restaurant, but not for a grab and go lunch spot. \\n\\nPlenty of beverage options to choose from. Juice and salad station.

The drink selection was amazing. They had a lot more healthy drink options than most cafes like this which I really appreciated. The service was friendly as well.\\n\\nThere aren't that many seats downstairs but it wasn't very crowded when I went at all.

Sooo....gluten free....or extra measure to let people know the dish is full of the delicious stuff?\\n\\nWent to the register to get clarity from an employee. \\xa0Got a, \"Hello...\" as one employee ran away....another didn\\'t know the answer....so we had to go find someone who did. \\xa0Turns out they offer gluten-free Friday (one extra star given for this awesomeness).\\n\\nPiled up, and went to the register. \\xa0It cost nearly $40!!!!! \\xa0Turns out the price is $12.99/lb (significantly more expensive than Mangia, which at least offers quality, variety and culinary innovations WELL above their competitors, with offerings you can\\'t find elsewhere - you can find some or the exact same version of at least half Treehaus\\'s bar at a handful of other places)!!\\n\\nI asked the employee about the price I saw. \\xa0Answer, \"It\\'s $12.99.\" \\xa0No, \"Sorry, Sir. \\xa0But... *insert explanation that this is a price for a specific time*\". \\xa0Bent me over, ran my card, got me to sign, and that was it. \\xa0No offer for my receipt. \\xa0No thanks for my business.\\n\\n100% my bad for not inquiring about the price before going to town. \\xa0But, at this price tag:\\n\\n- Customer service should be beyond on point. \\xa0\\n- Chicken on the bone should be cooked through; as you\\'ll see pictured, I found an under cooked piece which I could not safely eat, making this an even larger waste of money. \\xa0\\n- Proteins shouldn\\'t be dried out; a few options looked moist, though all fish and the beef option were dried out. \\xa0\\n- Product quality and type of ingredient should be LEAP YEARS above competitors; theirs is either equal to or merely the slightest bit better. \\xa0\\n\\nLooks like there may be other items on their menu which are more reasonably priced. \\xa0But there isn\\'t much of anything which can\\'t be purchased elsewhere in the area at a much lower - sometimes even 50% lower - price. \\xa0And with subpar customer service?\\n\\nSomeone needs to chop down this tree house.',\n",

I\\'m also realizing that on the menu it included roasted peppers, but there were definitely not any roasted peppers on my sandwich.\\n\\nThe restaurant has four or five different kitchens (buffet, juice bar, salad bar, sushi burritos, and noodle bar), and I might try again at one of the other kitchens next time. Just avoid the eggplant sandwich at all costs.\\n\\nTip to the business owner: You\\'ve got a huge chalkboard sign above the grill area advertising your \"Burrito Special\", which looks great, until you realize there\\'s a 8.5x11\" sheet of paper pasted at the bottom that says \"No Burrito Spacial\".

       "  'reviews': [\"I've bought shakes and smoothies from here before. I recently stopped by after a gym session with my wife and we decided to get some shakes. I got a Green P.B. shake with a scoop of Whey Protein(which was $1 extra) and my wife got the Green Boost. \\nBoth tasted very fresh and flavorful. \\nI didn't order a salad but I saw on their menu that you can get a $6.75 medium salad with protein and veggies, which I think is such a bargain. \\nWill definitely be going back whenever I'm in the mood for a shake after a workout or a healthy meal!\",\n",
       "   \"Ordered delivery:\\nCaribbean quinoa bowl (with grilled chicken and avocado) \\n-they called and said they didn't have the Caribbean mango sauce so I opted for Italian dressing but didn't really need it! The salad is already flavored with the pineapple and mangos. Would highly recommend!\\n\\nAnd a green lagoon smoothie\\n-cheap, classic, not extremely sweet \\n\\nMy order came fast despite the 75-105 minute wait listed. \\nWould order from here again\",\n",

       "   \"Mmmmm....sandwiches, smoothies, and salads...oh my! Blue Coco is filling the one void the East Harlem lunch scene has had for a while...tasty hot sandwiches. Don't get me wrong, there is some darn good food in East Harlem. But the lunch scene can feel a little redundant at times and lately I've longed for a really tasty panini or hot sandwich. Finally, Blue Coco to the rescue. The sandwiches are the perfect size for lunch and they grill them to just the right temperature to melt cheese, toast bread and avoid any weird singed edges. Call me crazy, but I notice these things! I hate leaving the little leftover burned bites when I want to gobble down a sandwich whole. The Coco Tomping is a customer favorite and I see why. It's not overstuffed, making it easy to eat and savor, and that chicken cutlet was a hefty well seasoned piece. You get a good bang for your buck with this sandwich, I was full for the rest of the afternoon and well into the evening. There's a customer appreciation program for every ten sandwiches bought (I think salads may count too) and you are automatically enrolled on your first purchase, which is great because I always forget all those little punch card things. My coworkers love the salads here as well and I'm looking forward to trying those too. Oh and I gotta try the Morir Sonando smoothie. Only in East Harlem will you find a Morir Sonando smoothie. That's pretty genius I'm definitely going for that next!\",\n",

       "   \"This is my favorite breakfast, lunch, smoothie, salad, egg & cheese, healthy wrap, food place in East Harlem lol. I love coming here for all the things that were previously listed and I even get large catered breakfast orders (including coffee) from here. The owner is a gem and they are very reliable on the delivery. I order from here EVERY TIME I'm in that area or I have a morning event that needs food. Stop in here whenever you are in the neighborhood and I doubt you will be disappointed.\",\n",

       "   \"Blue CoCo offers the variety and freshness of trendy health foods at a fraction of the price! Tucked away in East Harlem, this gem has quick service, amazing options, and deals galore! With every ten purchases, you can get a small smoothie for free! And if you don't want to make that many purchases? A small (16 oz) smoothie is only $4! My personal fave is the heart healthy one, which includes berries, yogurt, spinach, and flax. And they offer a medium size of 20 oz for only a dollar more - the perfect size in my opinion. I haven't tried their salads, bowls, or açaí bowls, but they are very reasonably priced ($6.50 for a fresh salad in New York?! Unheard of!). Furthermore, they offer discounts if you go in between 3-6 PM! My only gripe is that it closes by 7 PM, so it's a bit difficult to go to for dinner, and it's closed on Sundays. Other than that, wonderful place that shows that it's possible to offer healthy, fresh, affordable food!\",\n",

It is a pretty small space, so there was not much of a line and I was able to order right away.\\n\\nI decided to go with a sandwich that had grilled chicken, spinach, avocado, and their house chipotle sauce. \\n\\nWith sandwiches around the city, you never know what the quality is going to be. Thankfully, this place serves up some tasty food options. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the combination of spinach, avocado, and chipotle sauce really won me over.\\n\\nThough the sandwich took a little while to come out, the end result was totally worth it.',\n",
       "   \"I swear by this place ! amazing sandwiches , I love the their \\xa0salads and they've helped me transition from a meat eater to a plant based diet . My entire office orders from here and it's great to have healthy choices in the neighborhood. I'm a fan girl !\",\n",
       "   \"Custom sandwiches with that small business feel.\\n\\nRecently opened, Blue CoCo is a cute little sandwich shop trying to make it in East Harlem. The interior is (surprise surprise) a sharp blue color scheme and the menus are drawn directly onto the wall. With a huge selection of sandwiches, juices, and smoothies, I opted for a CoCo Tomping (not sure if I'm spelling that one right...) on a whole wheat roll.\\n\\nAfter some prep, I had a piping hot sandwich ready to go. They even included a free bottle of water for a reason I forgot. The chicken was properly seasoned and the avocado made a huge difference in bringing everything together. There was some sort of aioli spread that was a pleasant surprise. It's a fairly lean sandwich, and I think it works for their price point. A $5-6 sandwich made for a perfect midday snack, although I don't think it would make for the most filling dinner.\\n\\nMy only complaint is the wait. Because the sandwiches are made to order and grilled for a bit before service, it took a good 10 minutes for my sandwich and there was no wait. I think improvements should come with time and I'll be calling ahead my order for the future. Their rewards program (buy seven items, get the eighth free) is really generous, and I'm excited for the healthier option in the neighborhood!\",\n",
       "   \"This is a great place. I don't like to order out as it can be hit and miss. BUT I have made several orders from Blue CoCo. I don't write reviews, but do read them. So felt I had to write one in this case to alert everyone to this outstanding restaurant. The food is excellent. The drinks the best and the service is beyond good. Usually the food arrives well before the estimated time of arrival. Still VERY hot.\",\n",

       "   \"Could have been better. Overpriced smoothie, coulda made it myself. They charge you extra for everything!!! The Caesar salad isn't too bad, wish I coulda gotten more lettuce for the price.\",\n",
       "   \"Love Love Love this place. I just started working in the area so I'm not to familiar with East Harlem. I was looking for healthy food options and to no surprise there aren't many in the area, and then I stumbled across this beautiful gem. The first impression was this is a cute place. The colors of the place gave me an island's vibe. The menu was hand written on the wall, big and clear for everyone to see which I loved. The lady behind the counter was very nice. The salads and green smoothies are fresh!!! I love this place and will continue to come back\",\n",
       "   'Solid 4 stars for this small sandwich salad place. I had the pepperocini sandwich which has salami mozzarella roasted peppers avocado spinach and mayo. The sandwich is constructed properly with thinly sliced avocado that makes the sandwich very stable. No slippin and slidin while taking a bite. Cute place that does smoothies also.

The ingredients were unbelievably fresh and an awesome value compared to anything I've gotten around here.\\n\\nObviously if you don't like Subway you probably won't like this, but I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't completely hate their food. I'll definitely be coming back here to get my sandwich fix from now on.\",\n",

As far as the food goes, it's a Subway, very much like any other. It helps to know what you want before you order; I usually let other people get in line in front of me while I decide (I particularly like the wraps and the salad plates; you can have any sandwich as a salad, if you like). The vegetables are always fresh, and they have vegetarian options for those so inclined.\",\n",

The sammich prep folks are much more meticulous than the one on 3rd&56st, which spreads your fixins haphazardly like they are in a rush to catch a plane or something. I always get the Roast Chicken, even though it\\'s piecemealed chicken breast, since it\\'s maximum meatage for buckage. You get one breast patty per 6\" sub. It\\'s either that or a mystery bbq rib sammich. Definitely ask for your sub to be toasted. It only takes 30 seconds. Now that I can get a footlong for $5, it\\'s a great deal for lunch. This place also honors all Subway coupons so sometimes you can get 2-for-1 footlongs. In addition, you can get two 6\" subs for $5 after 5pm here. I \\xa0ask for all the fixins (minus jalapenos, raw onion) as that\\'s the only way I\\'ll meet my veggie quota for the day. I always ask for the Southwest sauce and black pepper on top. I know it\\'s bad for you but at least nothing is fried or oily in this sammich. Guessing that footlong is roughly a 750 calorie meal if you drink water. I\\'m always tempted to fuck with them just for the hell of it and ask for an ABLT or something.\\n\\nYou see all walks of life here:\\n1) That one sista who never wanted anything to begin with. They get her order right but she says that\\'s not what she ordered and walks away. \\n2) The corporate yuppie who wants to eat somewhat healthy to maintain his/her girlish figure\\n3) Those greedy fucks that ask for more fixins.

I got a Green P.B. shake with a scoop of Whey Protein(which was $1 extra) and my wife got the Green Boost. \\nBoth tasted very fresh and flavorful. \\nI didn't order a salad but I saw on their menu that you can get a $6.75 medium salad with protein and veggies, which I think is such a bargain. \\nWill definitely be going back whenever I'm in the mood for a shake after a workout or a healthy meal!\",\n",
       "  \"Ordered delivery:\\nCaribbean quinoa bowl (with grilled chicken and avocado) \\n-they called and said they didn't have the Caribbean mango sauce so I opted for Italian dressing but didn't really need it! The salad is already flavored with the pineapple and mangos. Would highly recommend!\\n\\nAnd a green lagoon smoothie\\n-cheap, classic, not extremely sweet \\n\\nMy order came fast despite the 75-105 minute wait listed. \\nWould order from here again\",\n",
       "  'I wish I could give ten stars, the service was good along with great food - I recommend everyone should try the blueberry lagoon smoothie* omg delicious',\n",
       "  \"I ordered lunch from here several times and my order is always missing something. I even paid for extra items and didn't receive any at all. I always ask for my order repeatedly before hanging up and I'm always disappointed. Never again.\",\n",
       "  \"Mmmmm....sandwiches, smoothies, and salads...oh my! Blue Coco is filling the one void the East Harlem lunch scene has had for a while...tasty hot sandwiches. Don't get me wrong, there is some darn good food in East Harlem. But the lunch scene can feel a little redundant at times and lately I've longed for a really tasty panini or hot sandwich. Finally, Blue Coco to the rescue. The sandwiches are the perfect size for lunch and they grill them to just the right temperature to melt cheese, toast bread and avoid any weird singed edges. Call me crazy, but I notice these things! I hate leaving the little leftover burned bites when I want to gobble down a sandwich whole. The Coco Tomping is a customer favorite and I see why. It's not overstuffed, making it easy to eat and savor, and that chicken cutlet was a hefty well seasoned piece. You get a good bang for your buck with this sandwich, I was full for the rest of the afternoon and well into the evening. There's a customer appreciation program for every ten sandwiches bought (I think salads may count too) and you are automatically enrolled on your first purchase, which is great because I always forget all those little punch card things. My coworkers love the salads here as well and I'm looking forward to trying those too. Oh and I gotta try the Morir Sonando smoothie. Only in East Harlem will you find a Morir Sonando smoothie. That's pretty genius I'm definitely going for that next!\",\n",
       "  'Everything is clean. Smoothies are good. Prices are affordable. Great place for a healthy treat.',\n",
       "  \"This is my favorite breakfast, lunch, smoothie, salad, egg & cheese, healthy wrap, food place in East Harlem lol. I love coming here for all the things that were previously listed and I even get large catered breakfast orders (including coffee) from here. The owner is a gem and they are very reliable on the delivery. I order from here EVERY TIME I'm in that area or I have a morning event that needs food. Stop in here whenever you are in the neighborhood and I doubt you will be disappointed.\",\n",
       "  'Great salads. Comes with fresh grilled bread and the lemon dressing was great. This is my new go to salad spot uptown.',\n",
       "  \"Blue CoCo offers the variety and freshness of trendy health foods at a fraction of the price! Tucked away in East Harlem, this gem has quick service, amazing options, and deals galore! With every ten purchases, you can get a small smoothie for free! And if you don't want to make that many purchases? A small (16 oz) smoothie is only $4! My personal fave is the heart healthy one, which includes berries, yogurt, spinach, and flax. And they offer a medium size of 20 oz for only a dollar more - the perfect size in my opinion. I haven't tried their salads, bowls, or açaí bowls, but they are very reasonably priced ($6.50 for a fresh salad in New York?! Unheard of!). Furthermore, they offer discounts if you go in between 3-6 PM! My only gripe is that it closes by 7 PM, so it's a bit difficult to go to for dinner, and it's closed on Sundays. Other than that, wonderful place that shows that it's possible to offer healthy, fresh, affordable food!\",\n",

It is a pretty small space, so there was not much of a line and I was able to order right away.\\n\\nI decided to go with a sandwich that had grilled chicken, spinach, avocado, and their house chipotle sauce. \\n\\nWith sandwiches around the city, you never know what the quality is going to be. Thankfully, this place serves up some tasty food options. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the combination of spinach, avocado, and chipotle sauce really won me over.\\n\\nThough the sandwich took a little while to come out, the end result was totally worth it.',\n",
       "  \"I swear by this place ! amazing sandwiches , I love the their \\xa0salads and they've helped me transition from a meat eater to a plant based diet . My entire office orders from here and it's great to have healthy choices in the neighborhood. I'm a fan girl !\",\n",
       "  \"Custom sandwiches with that small business feel.\\n\\nRecently opened, Blue CoCo is a cute little sandwich shop trying to make it in East Harlem. The interior is (surprise surprise) a sharp blue color scheme and the menus are drawn directly onto the wall. With a huge selection of sandwiches, juices, and smoothies, I opted for a CoCo Tomping (not sure if I'm spelling that one right...) on a whole wheat roll.\\n\\nAfter some prep, I had a piping hot sandwich ready to go. They even included a free bottle of water for a reason I forgot. The chicken was properly seasoned and the avocado made a huge difference in bringing everything together. There was some sort of aioli spread that was a pleasant surprise. It's a fairly lean sandwich, and I think it works for their price point. A $5-6 sandwich made for a perfect midday snack, although I don't think it would make for the most filling dinner.\\n\\nMy only complaint is the wait. Because the sandwiches are made to order and grilled for a bit before service, it took a good 10 minutes for my sandwich and there was no wait. I think improvements should come with time and I'll be calling ahead my order for the future. Their rewards program (buy seven items, get the eighth free) is really generous, and I'm excited for the healthier option in the neighborhood!\",\n",
       "  \"This is a great place. I don't like to order out as it can be hit and miss. BUT I have made several orders from Blue CoCo. I don't write reviews, but do read them. So felt I had to write one in this case to alert everyone to this outstanding restaurant. The food is excellent. The drinks the best and the service is beyond good. Usually the food arrives well before the estimated time of arrival. Still VERY hot.\",\n",
       "  'The young ladies working here are very kind. This place is giving residents healthier food choices. I had the morir soñando and the cheeses sandwich.',\n",
       "  \"Could have been better. Overpriced smoothie, coulda made it myself. They charge you extra for everything!!! The Caesar salad isn't too bad, wish I coulda gotten more lettuce for the price.\",\n",

I was looking for healthy food options and to no surprise there aren't many in the area, and then I stumbled across this beautiful gem. The first impression was this is a cute place. The colors of the place gave me an island's vibe. The menu was hand written on the wall, big and clear for everyone to see which I loved. The lady behind the counter was very nice. The salads and green smoothies are fresh!!! I love this place and will continue to come back\",\n",
